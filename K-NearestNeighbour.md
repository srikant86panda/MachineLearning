# K-NearestNeighbour

## Overview
* Instance based/ Lazy learning.
* Computation is dealyed till classification.
* Simple technique where there is little or no knowledge on distribution of data.

## Advantage of KNN
* Robust to noise.
* Effective when training data is large.
* No training phase is needed.
* Learn complex model easily.

## Disadvantage of KNN
* Need to know K that works well.
* Not clear which types of distance metric to be used.
* Computation cost is high with high dimension datasets.

## Bias, Variance tradeoff
* Lower vallue of k creates complex model riskying overfitting.
* Higher value of k creates simple model riskying underfitting.
